            About Central America
        </h1>
        <p>
            Central america is all of the countries south of the United States
            but north of columbia. It's most famous ancient civilization was the Aztecs.
            The Aztecs had a unique form of government that was dictated by a tributary
            system where local "lords", for lack of a better term. Payed tribute to the
            Tlatoani or the hueyi tlahtoani. In english those are called "speaker" and
            "great ruler".

        <h2>
            Central america and the US.
        </h2>
        <p>
            US & central american relations were complicated. The US assisted with the
            building of the Panama canal which assisted global trade routes however they
            did not own it until 1979.
            <br>
            There is a lot more than meets the eye on this subject. But from a certain perspective
            you can estimate that the more time went on in both the 19th and 20th centuries. The
            more the United States has intervened in central american countries for economic or private
            interests.
            <br>
            what i would like for you to be aware of as a example would be the banana wars. So called
            because of the result of the "wars" to be the nations known as the banana republics.
            Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica are claimed to be these nations by various sources.
