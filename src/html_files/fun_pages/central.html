                    About South America
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Central america is all of the countries south of the United States <br>
                    but north of columbia. It's most famous ancient civilization was the Aztecs. <br>
                    The Aztecs had a unique form of government that was dictated by a tributary <br>
                    system where local "lords", for lack of a better term. Payed tribute to the <br>
                    Tlatoani or the hueyi tlahtoani. In english those are called "speaker" and <br>
                    "great ruler". <br>
                    <br>
                    however when people think of ancient civilizations in central america <br>
                    south of Mexico. they usually refer to the Maya. They are a different civilization. <br>

                <h2>
                    Central america and the US.
                </h2>
                <p>
                    US & central american relations were complicated. The US assisted with the <br>
                    building of the Panama canal which assisted global trade routes however they <br>
                    did not own it until 1979. <br>
                    <br>
                    There is a lot more than meets the eye on this subject. But from a certain perspective <br>
                    you can estimate that the more time went on in both the 19th and 20th centuries. The <br>
                    more the United States has intervened in central american countries for economic or private <br>
                    interests.
                    <br>
                    what i would like for you to be aware of as a example would be the banana wars. So called <br>
                    because of the result of the "wars" to be the nations known as the banana republics. <br>
                    Honduras, Guatemala and Costa Rica are claimed to be these nations by various sources. <br>
