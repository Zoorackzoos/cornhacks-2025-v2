                    South America includes the countries south of columbia to north of Argentina. <br>
                    For those who do not know, continents are not created because they are all divided <br>
                    by seas or rivers or mountains but actually more by the cultural differences <br>
                    those geographic boundaries case. <br>
                    <br>
                    South America has possibly more of a strange political climate the United States. <br>
                    According to a few sources, the president of Argentina as of now, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javier_Milei">Javier Milei</a>
                    has cloned his dog by the name of Conan 5 times, dresses up as a superhero and recently <br>
                    orchestrated a cryptocurrency rug pull scam. <br>
                    <br>
                    the previous standing president as of 2025 Dina Boluarte has possibly one of the worst approval ratings in history <br>
                    with a whopping 90% dis-approval rate as well as a scandal by the name of "Rolex Gate" which alleges <br>
                    that she took bribes a construction company, and not only that but everybody before and after her has done <br>
                    the exact same thing. Received, in one way or another, bribes from Peruvian construction companies. <br>
                    <br>
                    Brazil. in all of it's might and murder capital glory. had a very similar January 6th capital storming event <br>
                    it's a very complicated issue, like most things political. But a politician by the name of John Bolsonaro <br>
                    claimed in 2022 that election was fraudulent which led to his supporters storming the capital hoping to take power <br>
                    <br>
                    they were not successful. These riots are called the 8 January Brasília attacks <br>
